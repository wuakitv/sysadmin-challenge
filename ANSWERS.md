How long did it take to finish the test?
        It took me 3 days to built the setup and deploy the code.

If you had more time, how could you improve your solution?
        for basic development enviroment its sufficent

What changes would you do to your solution to be deployed in a production environment?
        I will implement some security features such as TLS termination in web proxy. 
        I will enhance the deployment.yaml file where I will add more objects such as relplicaset , resource limit where I will descrbie the CPU and RAM utilization. I will create seperate namespace for producton pods . 
        I will create RBAC feature where only seelceted team  can access the pods. 
        I will deloy some metrics agenst suh as prometheus for alerting and log analaytics.

Why did you choose this language over others?
        I am proficent in python and I want to enhance my skill in this language.

What was the most challenging part and why?
        For me most chalanging part was wrting ingress yaml file and setting it in the cluster since I have used my local dektop ingress was not working properly.
