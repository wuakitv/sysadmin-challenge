## Introduction

We need to deploy a new microservice that given a `GET` request to the `/hello` endpoint it will return a JSON response with the following content:

```json
{ "hello": "world" }
```

Approach:- 
	My approach is simple yet eligent . I  am  more focussed towards code and uniformity of the application and setup. Keeping uniformity in my mind 
	I have used kuberenetes and docker for this deployment. I have created setup which is more inclined towards infrastructure as code. 
	For programming , I have used simple python flask framework because it is light weight and easy to understand. Also given application  is not tightly
	coupled with database. I have written the code in my local virtual environment which has got all its dependencies in requirements.txt file. 

  steps involved :-
      1. Write code in wuaki.py 
              I have used flask simplying importing the flask module. Created the flask object and used function decorator route to reroute all the request to /hello URI path , then wrote the hello() which print hello world in json format using jsonify object. Then run the app {0.0.0.0} which will allow the connection from any host by default on 8080 port.

      2. Write Dockerfile. 
              First line in the docker file  is simplying pulling the pyton base image . Second line is simply updating the apt repo . I then created the project folder wuaki and copied all the root directory file inside it, then installed requirements.txt file for all dependencies such as flask.
                 command used -- pip freeze > requirements.txt
                                pip install requirements.txt
    
      3. Build docker image.
              Once the dockerfile is created , build the image. 
              command i used ;
                docker build -t wuakitv .   --> To build the docker image
                                                image sha256:25859e029feabd574fa648c5c1822b427611e0bff697def8ddf0d9d6bdd1d333
                To see the docker images -> docker images 
		                wuakitv                                                                      latest                                                                     25859e029fea   41 seconds ago   157MB
	              I have tagged the image and push to my repository . Here I have used docker hub as repo. 
		                docker tag wuakitv ranjan21/wuakitv
                    docker push ranjan21/wuakitv.
        
      4. Create Kuberentes Resource. 
              Since i have used docer desktop for this project where kubernetes single nodes comes by defult. Now My approach is to create  kubernetes resources for the deployment of the web application. 
                  In deployement.yaml file I have written k8 spec where i created deployment and service api endpoints of k8.
                  Here i used my self build docker image which i created in the above steps - docker.io/ranjan21/wuakitv.
                  I exposed the service as load balancer since i wnated to have this application on internet. 
                  command used :-
                          kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
                          kubect get deployment
                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % kubectl get deployment
                          NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
                          wuakitv-app   1/1     1            1           2d14h

                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % kubectl get svc
                          NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
                          kubernetes        ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          11d
                          wuakitv-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.33.201   localhost     8080:31437/TCP   2d14h

                  From the above command output we can clearly see all our service and resource is deployed. and wuakitv servcie is exposed to loadbalancer.

          5. Deploy web proxy. 
                  Since I have used kuberenetes , I make use of inbuilt feature of nginx-ingress controller to act as web proxy.
                  I cretaed ingress  yaml file where i described rule to route  any incoming traffic to loacalhost to /hello path based routing attached to service wuakitv-service. 
                  Here i havent used tls termination rule as it was optional but there is room for improvement where we can have tls certificate  and do ssl termination in nginx controller. 
                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % kubectl get ing       
                          NAME            CLASS   HOSTS       ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
                          wuaki-ingress   nginx   localhost   localhost   80      37h

                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % curl -L http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello
                          {"Hello":"World"}

                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % curl -L http://127.0.0.1:80/hello  
                          curl: (52) Empty reply from server
                          abhishekranjan@Abhisheks-MacBook-Pro sysadmin-challenge % curl -L http://127.0.0.1:8081/hello
                          curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8081: Connection refused



Software requirements:
      We need to have docker and kuberentes cluster and signed docker registry to upload the images.

The rationale explaining why you chose this solution over others.
      I chose this solution because this is more articulate and prominently used in IT industries . We dont require too many of hardware. Also kuberenetes is flagship technology which eases the code deployment and helps in CICD approach . While making this setup i have retwiked the code several times and rebuild the image n number of times. For me it took almost minute  to complete the cycle. Once the setup is ready ,modification and other enhancement is quite easy  as you can implement your changes too quickly. 
      Secind best part is everything is mainatined as code in a central repo so changes are done are reflected easily.
